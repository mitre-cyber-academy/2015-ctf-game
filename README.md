    <td>In an attempt at industrial espionage, a toy company has hired you to get information from a rival company. Here's what they know: the target company sends "Weekly Report" emails to its employees. The reports usually link to an internal file server for download and viewing. For reasons unknown, one employee registered his personal email on the list and has a tendency to use this email at work. His email is ggrievousctf@gmail.com and from what we can tell, he's not the most tech savvy and will probably open anything you send him if it looks like a Weekly Report.  The rival company knows that the primary designer for the target company is named Dooku and they want you to extract as much as you can from his system.  Happy Hunting!

Because you don't want to get any food on the belt, you set it next to you. After finishing the salad, you notice that the belt is now gone and replaced with a "note". What does the note say?

You have intercepted an "image" that looks like it may contain some interesting information based on the other requests and responses coming from that IP. Unfortunately, the image has been corrupted during transmission and you now need to unscramble it. Note: Key is 10 hex digits.</td>

Here are all the emails I have theoretically gotten from Slim. Oh, and it probably won't be much use, but here's what's left of our website, in case it helps you design the new [website".

#### Regex used to assist in generating this file (The first block is placed in the "Find" block and the second in the "Replace" block in sublime)

This regex can be used on the result of the exported challenges with only the "Name" associated field checked for category and all associated flag fields unchecked. You will need to export as json and then use an online converter to convert it to yaml.

**Find Block:**

    - 
      id: .+
      name: "((.|^\")+?)"
      description: "([\w\W]*?)"
      point_value: (.+)
      state: .+
      created_at: .+
      updated_at: .+
      achievement_name: .+
      category: 
        name: "((.|^\")+?)"

**Replace Block:**

    <tr>
      <td>\1</td>
      <td>\4</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/mitre-cyber-academy/2015-\5-\4">2015-\5-\4</a></td>
      <td>\3</td>
    </tr>

Next, you will need to do a find replace to get rid of all links:

**Find Block:**

        \[(.*)\]\(.*\)

**Replace Block:**

        "\1"
